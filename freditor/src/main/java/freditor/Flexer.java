/**
 * States are encoded by numbers (which are stored alongside the characters).
 * <p>
 * Negative numbers denote states that are entered by the first character of a lexeme;
 * This enables the syntax highlighter to detect the beginning of a new lexeme.
 * Hence, all other states MUST use positive numbers!
 * As a consequence, identifiers require at least two states:
 * a negative for the first character, and a positive for the following characters.
 * <p>
 * The number 0 denotes a special end state. If you encounter a character
 * that does not belong to the current lexeme, return 0.
 * The system will then start a new lexeme at the very same character.
